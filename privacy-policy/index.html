        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          Travel Document Vault is designed to provide a secure, local environment for managing your personal travel documents. Our philosophy is strict data isolation: we believe your sensitive documents belong solely to you, on your device. This Application operates without user accounts, cloud synchronization, or backend servers.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          To be clear about our privacy-first approach, we do <strong class="text-white">not</strong> collect:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-300 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)</li>
          <li>Document images or scans</li>
          <li>Passport numbers, visa numbers, or other document identifiers</li>
          <li>Travel plans or itineraries</li>
          <li>Location data</li>
          <li>Usage analytics or behavioral data</li>
          <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">Information Handling</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          All information entered into the Application—including document images, passport details, notes, and expiry dates—remains exclusively on your local device. The Application utilizes on-device Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology solely to assist in data entry. This processing occurs entirely within the device's secure sandbox; no image data or extracted text is transmitted to external servers for processing or analysis.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">On-Device Storage</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          Your data is stored securely on your device using system protections. The Application leverages the native security features of the operating system to ensure data isolation. We do not maintain any external databases, and the Application does not possess the capability to sync, backup, or upload your content to any cloud service or third-party server.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">Data Retention</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          Your data persists on your device for as long as you choose to keep the Application installed. Since all data is stored locally:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-300 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>Data remains on your device until you manually delete it within the app or uninstall the Application</li>
          <li>Uninstalling the Application permanently deletes all associated data</li>
          <li>We cannot access, recover, or delete your data remotely</li>
          <li>You have full control over your data at all times</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">Data Sharing</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          Data export or sharing is strictly user-initiated. Information leaves the Application only when you explicitly interact with the system share sheet to send a document or detail. The Application performs no background transmission of data.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          The Application minimizes reliance on external services to preserve privacy. We do not use advertising networks or third-party analytics for tracking user behavior.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mt-4">Crash Reporting (Sentry)</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          The Application uses <strong class="text-white">Sentry</strong> (sentry.io) for crash reporting to help us identify and fix application errors. This service may collect:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-300 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>Device type and model</li>
          <li>Operating system version</li>
          <li>Application version</li>
          <li>Anonymized crash stack traces</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mt-3">
          Crash reports do <strong class="text-white">not</strong> include:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-300 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>Document images or scans</li>
          <li>Document contents or metadata you've entered</li>
          <li>OCR data or extracted text</li>
          <li>Any files stored within the Application</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mt-3">
          <strong class="text-white">You can disable crash reporting</strong> at any time in the Application's Settings. All document storage and OCR processing remain entirely on the device and are never transmitted to Sentry or any external server.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">Notifications</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          Expiry reminders are managed locally via the device's notification center. The scheduling and delivery of these alerts occur entirely on-device, ensuring that your travel plans and document expiry dates are not tracked externally. Notification content is privacy-conscious and does not reveal sensitive document details by default.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">User Control</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          You retain complete autonomy over your data. You may add, modify, export, or permanently delete records at your discretion. As there are no user accounts or remote servers, deleting the Application from your device results in the immediate and permanent removal of all associated local data.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          The Application is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since the Application does not collect any personal information and stores all data locally on your device, there is no mechanism through which we could collect data from children.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided information to us, please contact us at the email address below. However, please note that since we do not operate servers or collect data, we have no data to delete.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">International Users (GDPR)</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          If you are accessing the Application from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-300 space-y-1 ml-4">
          <li>We do not transfer your personal data outside of your device</li>
          <li>All data processing occurs locally on your device</li>
          <li>You have complete control over your data, including the right to access, modify, and delete it at any time through the Application</li>
          <li>Since we do not collect or store your data externally, there is no data for us to provide, correct, or delete upon request</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mt-3">
          The only data we may receive is anonymized crash reports (if enabled), which do not contain personal information and are used solely for improving Application stability.

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">California Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          California residents may have additional rights regarding their personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). However, since we do not collect, sell, or share personal information, these provisions do not apply to our data practices. All data remains on your device under your exclusive control.
