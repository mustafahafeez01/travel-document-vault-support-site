          Mustafa Hafeez (“we” or “us” or “our”) respects the privacy of our users (“user” or “you”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our mobile application (the “Application”). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. <span class="font-bold text-white">IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS THE APPLICATION.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
          We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the Application after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
          This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online/mobile store from which you install the Application or make payments, which may also collect and use data about you. We are not responsible for any of the data collected by any such third party.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          Travel Document Vault is designed to provide a secure, local environment for managing your personal travel documents. Our philosophy is strict data isolation: we believe your sensitive documents belong solely to you, on your device. This Application operates without user accounts, cloud synchronization, or backend servers.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">Information Handling</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          All information entered into the Application—including document images, passport details, notes, and expiry dates—remains exclusively on your local device. The Application utilizes on-device Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology solely to assist in data entry. This processing occurs entirely within the device's secure sandbox; no image data or extracted text is transmitted to external servers for processing or analysis.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">On-Device Storage</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          Your data is stored securely on your device using system protections. The Application leverages the native security features of the operating system to ensure data isolation. We do not maintain any external databases, and the Application does not possess the capability to sync, backup, or upload your content to any cloud service or third-party server.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">Data Sharing</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          Data export or sharing is strictly user-initiated. Information leaves the Application only when you explicitly interact with the system share sheet to send a document or detail. The Application performs no background transmission of data.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          The Application minimizes reliance on external services to preserve privacy. We do not use advertising networks or third-party analytics for tracking user behavior.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          The Application uses a third-party crash reporting service (Sentry) to collect technical diagnostics in the event of an error or crash. This may include device information (such as operating system version, device model, and app version) and anonymized error logs.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          Crash reports do not include document images, document contents, OCR data, or any files stored within the Application. All document storage and OCR processing remain entirely on the device and are never transmitted to external servers.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">Notifications</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          Expiry reminders are managed locally via the device's notification center. The scheduling and delivery of these alerts occur entirely on-device, ensuring that your travel plans and document expiry dates are not tracked externally.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="space-y-3">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">User Control</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          You retain complete autonomy over your data. You may add, modify, export, or permanently delete records at your discretion. As there are no user accounts or remote servers, deleting the Application from your device results in the immediate and permanent removal of all associated local data.
        </p>
